.SH NAME
patool - simple manager for file archives of various types
.SH SYNOPSIS
 \fBpatool\fP (\fBextract\fP|\fBlist\fP|\fBtest\fP) [\fIoptions\fP] <\fIarchive-file\fP>
 \fBpatool\fP \fBcreate\fP [\fIoptions\fP] <\fIarchive-file\fP> [\fIfiles..\fP]
 \fBpatool\fP \fBformats\fP [\fIoptions\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Various archive types can be created, extracted, tested and listed by
\fBpatool\fP. The advantage of patool is its simplicity in handling archive
files without having to remember a myriad of programs and options.
.PP
The archive format is determined by the archive file extension and
as a fallback with file(1).
.PP
\fBpatool\fP supports 7z (.7z), ZIP (.zip, .jar), GZIP (.gz), compress (.Z),
BZIP2 (.bz2), TAR (.tar), ARJ (.arj), CAB (.cab), CPIO (.cpio),
RPM (.rpm), DEB (.deb), LZOP (.lzo), LZMA (.lzma), XZ (.xz) and RAR (.rar) formats.
It relies on helper applications to handle those archive formats
(for example bzip2 for BZIP2 archives).
.SH COMMANDS
Several commands and options are available.
.SS \fBextract\fP
Extract files from an archive4. Often one wants
to extract all files in an archive to a single subdirectory.
However, some archives contain multiple files in their root
directories. The patool program overcomes this problem by
first extracting files to a unique (temporary) directory, and
then moving its contents back if possible. This also prevents
local files from being overwritten by mistake.
.TP
\fB--force\fP
Allow overwriting of local files.
.TP
\fB\-\-verbose\fP
Be verbose when extracting (if the helper application supports it).
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fP
Show help for this command.
.SS \fBlist\fP
List files in an archive.
.TP
\fB\-\-verbose\fP
Verbose archive listing (if the helper application supports it).
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fP
Show help for this command.
.SS \fBcreate\fP
Create an archive from given files.
.TP
\fB--force\fP
Allow overwriting of local archives.
.TP
\fB\-\-verbose\fP
Verbose operation (if the helper application supports it).
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fP
Show help for this command.
.SS \fBtest\fP
Test files in an archive.
.TP
\fB\-\-verbose\fP
Verbose archive testing (if the helper application supports it).
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fP
Show help for this command.
.SS \fBformats\fP
Show all supported archive formats.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fP
Show help for this command.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The configuration files (see FILES) can specify which program to use
for each archive format. Per default a list of programs are searched
and the first one will be used for an archive.
.br
Additionally, default options like verbosity and force overwrite can
be configured.
.br
The configuration format is the Windows INI format.

.SS \fB[DEFAULT]\fP
.TP
\fBforce=0\fP
Set the force option to 1 or 0.
.TP
\fBverbose=0\fP
Set the verbose option to 1 or 0.
.SS \fB[\fP\fI<archive format>\fP\fB]\fP
Supported archive formats are listed by the \fBformats\fP command.
.TP
\fIcommand\fP\fB=/usr/bin/mycommand\fP
Set the application to handle the archive format for given command.
\fIcommand\fP can be one of (\fBextract\fP, \fBlist\fP, \fBtest\fP, \fBcreate\fP).
