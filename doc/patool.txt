NAME
       patool - simple manager for file archives of various types

SYNOPSIS
        patool (extract|list|test) [options] <archive-file>
        patool create [options] <archive-file> [files..]
        patool formats [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Various  archive  types  can  be created, extracted, tested and listed by patool.  The archive format is determined by the archive file extension and as a fallback with
       file(1).

       patool supports 7z (.7z), ZIP (.zip, .jar), GZIP (.gz), compress (.Z), BZIP2 (.bz2), TAR (.tar), ARJ (.arj), CAB (.cab), CPIO (.cpio),  RPM  (.rpm),  DEB  (.deb),  LZOP
       (.lzo)and RAR (.rar) formats.  It relies on helper applications to handle those archive formats (for example bzip2 for BZIP2 archives).

COMMANDS
       Several commands and options are available.

   extract
       Extract  files  from  an  archive4. Often one wants to extract all files in an archive to a single subdirectory.  However, some archives contain multiple files in their
       root directories. The patool program overcomes this problem by first extracting files to a unique (temporary) directory, and then moving its contents back if  possible.
       This also prevents local files from being overwritten by mistake.

       --force
              Allow overwriting of local files.

       --verbose
              Be verbose when extracting (if the helper application supports it).

       --help Show help for this command.

   list
       List files in an archive.

       --verbose
              Verbose archive listing (if the helper application supports it).

       --help Show help for this command.

   create
       Create an archive from given files.

       --force
              Allow overwriting of local archives.

       --verbose
              Verbose operation (if the helper application supports it).

       --help Show help for this command.

   test
       Test files in an archive.

       --verbose
              Verbose archive testing (if the helper application supports it).

       --help Show help for this command.

   formats
       Show all supported archive formats.

       --help Show help for this command.

CONFIGURATION
       The configuration files (see FILES) can specify which program to use for each archive format. Per default a list of programs are searched and the first one will be used
       for an archive.
       Additionally, default options like verbosity and force overwrite can be configured.
       The configuration format is the Windows INI format.


   [DEFAULT]
       force=0
              Set the force option to 1 or 0.

       verbose=0
              Set the verbose option to 1 or 0.

   [<archive format>]
       Supported archive formats are listed by the formats command.

       command=/usr/bin/mycommand
              Set the application to handle the archive format for given command.  command can be one of (extract, list, test, create).
