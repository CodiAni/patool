PATOOL(1)                                                                                                                                                             PATOOL(1)



NAME
       patool - simple manager for file archives of various types

SYNOPSIS
        patool (extract|list|test) [options] <archive-file>
        patool create [options] <archive-file> [files..]
        patool formats [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Various  archive  types  can  be  created, extracted, tested and listed by patool. The advantage of patool is its simplicity in handling archive files without having to
       remember a myriad of programs and options.

       The archive format is determined by the archive file extension and as a fallback with file(1).

       patool supports 7z (.7z), ZIP (.zip, .jar), GZIP (.gz), compress (.Z), BZIP2 (.bz2), TAR (.tar), ARJ (.arj), CAB (.cab), CPIO (.cpio),  RPM  (.rpm),  DEB  (.deb),  LZIP
       (.lz),  LZOP  (.lzo),  LZMA (.lzma), RAR (.rar) and XZ (.xz) formats.  It relies on helper applications to handle those archive formats (for example bzip2 for BZIP2 ar‐
       chives).

COMMANDS
       Several commands and options are available.

   extract
       Extract files from an archive4. Often one wants to extract all files in an archive to a single subdirectory.  However, some archives contain  multiple  files  in  their
       root  directories. The patool program overcomes this problem by first extracting files to a unique (temporary) directory, and then moving its contents back if possible.
       This also prevents local files from being overwritten by mistake.

       --force
              Allow overwriting of local files.

       --verbose
              Be verbose when extracting (if the helper application supports it).

       --help Show help for this command.

   list
       List files in an archive.

       --verbose
              Verbose archive listing (if the helper application supports it).

       --help Show help for this command.

   create
       Create an archive from given files.

       --force
              Allow overwriting of local archives.

       --verbose
              Verbose operation (if the helper application supports it).

       --help Show help for this command.

   test
       Test files in an archive.

       --verbose
              Verbose archive testing (if the helper application supports it).

       --help Show help for this command.

   formats
       Show all supported archive formats.

       --help Show help for this command.
